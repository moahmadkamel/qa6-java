3- Write a program, conditionally for a metal receiving warehouse. Let's imagine that a warehouse can store a certain weight of metal. The user enters the weight from the keyboard, which can be stored in the warehouse. Next, the user enters from the keyboard the weight that the user is conditionally going to deliver to the warehouse. After each delivery of metal, the program should show how much weight the warehouse can still accept. If the user wants to hand over more metal than there is space left in the warehouse, the program does not allow him to do this and notifies the user that this operation is impossible. If the user hands over metal weighing less than 5, the program also warns that it is impossible to accept such a small weight. The program ends when there is no more space in the warehouse.
