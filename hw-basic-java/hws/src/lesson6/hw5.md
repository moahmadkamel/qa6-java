__Task:__

Write a "numbers" program that guesses a random number and asks the player to guess it.

**Technical requirements:**

• Using java.util.Random, the program guesses a random number in the range [0-100] and offers the player to enter his name through the console, which is stored in the name variable.

• Before the start, the text is displayed on the screen: Let the game begin!

• The game process itself is processed in an infinite loop.

• The player is asked to enter a number into the console, after which the program compares the guessed number with what the user entered.

• If the entered number is less than the guessed number, the program displays the text: Your number is too small. Please, try again.. If the entered number is greater than the guessed number, the program displays the text: Your number is too big. Please, try again..

• If the entered number corresponds to the guessed number, the program displays the text: Congratulations, {name}!

• The task must be performed using arrays (DO NOT use List, Set, Map interfaces).
