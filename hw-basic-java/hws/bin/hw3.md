1- You have the line “I test great. What else do you need?”, which must be entered from the keyboard into the console.

It is necessary, using only the next() method of the Scanner class (we do not use the nextLine() method), to assign the following values to variables of the String type: string1 = I string2 = testing string3 = great string4 = What else is needed? In addition to string1, string2, string3, string4, new variables cannot be created.

2- The user enters three integer values from the keyboard. Information is displayed on the screen whether it is possible to construct a triangle from these sides. 
(you need to remember the rule for constructing a triangle using three sides).

3- Using the ternary operator, you need to get the difference of two numbers entered from the keyboard, and always subtract the smaller from the larger. Print this difference to the console.

4- (Use if-else-if statements) The user enters numbers from the keyboard: If the number is 1, then “Monday” is displayed on the console; If the number is 2, then “Tuesday” is displayed on the console; If the number is 3, then output to the console “Wednesday”; If the number is 4, then “Thursday” is displayed on the console; If the number is 5, then “Friday” is displayed on the console; If the number is 6, then “Saturday” is displayed on the console; If the number is 7, then “Sunday” is displayed on the console; Otherwise, we display the text: “It would be better if today were Friday.”

5- Write a program using the ternary operator, where the user enters two numbers and a symbol from the keyboard - or + or % or / or *. The result of the action on the two entered numbers is displayed on the screen. If the user entered something other than these characters, then 0 must be output.

6- Using the switch statement, write a program that displays a link to download the program on the console. From the selection of programs, take: IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Java. From the choice of OS, take: Linux, macOS, Windows. The program should ask the user what program he is interested in, also ask what OS he is using, and then display the necessary link in the console. If a program with the same name does not exist, it displays a message to the console stating that such a program does not exist. If the OS specified by the user does not exist, then a message is displayed in the console stating that such an OS does not exist.
